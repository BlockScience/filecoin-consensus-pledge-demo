    we must update at every timestep anyways, and new rewards are only added from the timestep forward
    Part 2 - Shift Reward Schedule. eg. {1: 10, 2: 20} -> {0: 10, 1: 20}
    Part 3 - Lock New Rewards. eg. {0: 10, 1: 20} -> {0: 15, 1: 25, 2: 5}

    1. Retrieve the Total Rewards during this timestep
    2. Iterate across the `AggregateSectors`
    3. Get their share of the Network QA Power: this is the % of the total reward
    due to them.
    4. For the Sector Total Reward, modify the reward schedule so that it incorporates them

    Eg. LINEAR_DURATION = 180 days means that the Total Reward should be split
    between 180 days. For 1 Timestep = 1 Day, that's 180 ts.

    Suppose LINEAR_DURATION = 3 days
    & sector_reward = 15 <=> sector_reward_per_day = 5
    & reward_schedule_init = {0: 20, 1: 30, 2: 40, 3: 50}
    then
    reward_schedule_final = {0: 20 + 5, 1: 30 + 5, 2: 40 + 5, 3: 50}
